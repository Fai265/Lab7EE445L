Checking integrity of Schematic "C:\Keil\EE445L\Lab7EE445L\RoboCrop.sch" with PCB "C:\Keil\EE445L\Lab7EE445L\RoboCrop.pcb"
==========================================================================================================================

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:

Disconnect Pin Q4-3 from Net "N0786"

Delete Net "N0786"

Component 'Barrel_Jack' package 'USER' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.
Component 'ESP8266' package 'USER' in Schematic is newer version than PCB, use Update Component to correct this.

Connect Pin Q4-3 to Net "Gnd"

Net "N0788" uses net class "Signal" in the schematic and net class "Power" in the PCB.
Net "N0804" uses net class "Signal" in the schematic and net class "Power" in the PCB.

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:

Component 'Barrel_Jack' package 'USER' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.
